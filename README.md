## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.
 
1. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install` along with an `npm install axios`
2. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
3. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
4. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
